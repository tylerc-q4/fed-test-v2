<!--
    How can you hide an element but still
    have it be tabbable?
-->

<style>
    .sr-only {
        
    }
</style>

<button class="sr-only">Skip to main content</button>




YES
- fixed/absolute positioning on screen + negative positioning off of screen
- opacity: 0
- width & height: 1px (not ideal but works)

NO
- display: none (not seen or read)
- visibility: hidden (not seen or read)
- height & width: 0 (most won't see or read)
